# Software Engineer in Python Test
My solution to one of the coding tests in Python that involves data analytics.

Written in Python 3.7 without any modules being used. Used PyCharm.

## Improvements to solution
Split the solution.py into a couple of different classes. For example, the time formatting should be in the date utilities class, salary processing in the salary class etc.
